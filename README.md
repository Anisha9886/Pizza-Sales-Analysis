# Pizza-Sales-Analysis


This Pizza Sales Dashboard is a project created using Excel and Pivot Tables to analyze pizza sales data. It provides a visual representation of key business metrics, including Total Revenue, Total Orders, Average Order Value, and Total Pizzas Sold. The dashboard includes charts and graphs to display daily and hourly sales trends, sales by pizza category and size, and best & worst sellers. A timeline slicer is added to filter data by specific periods. The project aims to help businesses understand sales patterns and improve decision-making in operations and marketing.
